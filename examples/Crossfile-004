# Example: Full workflow with sync, diff, and PR
just cross use demo https://github.com/example/demo-repo

# Patch a directory
just cross patch demo:docs vendor/docs

# Later: sync updates from upstream
# (simulated by updating the remote and running sync)

# Make local changes, diff them, and prepare PR
# (simulated by modifying files and testing diff/prepare-pr)
