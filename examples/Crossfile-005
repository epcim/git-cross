# Crossfile-005 - Testing exec post-hooks

# This example demonstrates how to use `exec` to run arbitrary commands
# specifically for post-hooks or setup steps.

# Define a post-hook that runs a recipe from the user's Justfile
just cross exec just posthook

# Another example: simple shell command
just cross exec echo "Crossfile-005 post-hook executed"
